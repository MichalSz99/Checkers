# Checkers

- The game is played  on an 8Ã—8 checkerboard. 
- Every player starts the game with 12 pieces set on dark squares. 
- The player with white pieces makes the first move and then the players alternate turns.
- The player, who do not have pieces remaining on the board or cannot move any pieces due to being blocked, loses the game. If any player cannot remove all pieces of the opponent or block them (every player moves 15 times without capturingopponent's piece), the game ended in a draw.
- Normal pieces (Man) can only move one step diagonally forward. Whenever a Man has an opponent's piece adjacent to it and the square immediatelybeyond the opponent's piece is vacant, the opponent's piece can be captured. A piece is captured by jumping over it into the vacant square beyond and removing it from the board. The men can jump both forward and backward.
- The capturing the enemy pieces, when it is possible, is obligatory. 
- In one turn player can capture a few enemy pieces using a single piece.
- Any piece that reaches the far edge of the board at the end of player's turn become a "King". 
- Kings can move any distance along unblocked diagonals both forward and backward andmay capture an opposing piece any distance away by jumping to any of the unoccupied squares immediately beyond it. 
- When there are a few capturing possibility, the player must chose the one, which remove the greatest amount of opponent\'s pieces.
